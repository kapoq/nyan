FAQ
---

* Didn't this meme jump the shark, like, ages ago?

Yes.

* It's got no tail

Look closer.

* It's got no feet!

LOOK CLOSER.

* It's really slow

Write faster specs.

* It's still really slow

Send me a pull request where the animation runs in a separate thread.

* The colours are all wrong

Probably need a new graphics card or something.

Requirements
------------

* Your terminal window should have a **black background** and be at least 180 columns x 50 rows.
* RSpec 2 (tested against RSpec 2.6)

Install
-------

Add to your `Gemfile` (usually inside your `:test` group):

    gem "nyan"

Alternatively install directly:

    $ gem install nyan

Usage
-----

Your terminal window should have a **black background** and be at
least 180 columns x 50 rows.

    $ rspec spec -f Nyan::Formatter

Or if you want the joy of Nyan without running specs, use the binary:

    $ nyan
